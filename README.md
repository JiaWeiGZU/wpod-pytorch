# WPOD-PYTORCH

## Intro
This is the PyTorch Version of WPOD
The following is to the source code and paper.
## Introduction
This repository contains the author's implementation of ECCV 2018 paper "License Plate Detection and Recognition in Unconstrained Scenarios".
* Paper webpage: http://sergiomsilva.com/pubs/alpr-unconstrained/
If you use results produced by our code in any publication, please cite our paper:
## Training
You can directly open and run by pycharm, train 200000 times, and the learning rate is 0.001 ，and batch-size = 52
The training image download link（link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1659QlXhnYBiugTHUj_L0nA?pwd=wjia 
Extraction code：wjia），and you can download the training image and put it in the project directory.
## testing
Directly run license plate detection Y file

## Reference weight file
After downloading the weight file, put it under the ". / weight" folder（link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1659QlXhnYBiugTHUj_L0nA?pwd=wjia 
Extraction code：wjia）Note：The weight file has only trained 40000 times. If you want to achieve better results, you can increase the number of training times
