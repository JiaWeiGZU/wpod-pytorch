# WPOD-PYTORCH

## Intro
This is the PyTorch Version of WPOD
The following is to the source code and paper.
## Introduction
This repository contains the author's implementation of ECCV 2018 paper "License Plate Detection and Recognition in Unconstrained Scenarios".

If you use results produced by our code in any publication, please cite our paper:
##Training
You can directly open and run by pycharm, train 200000 times, and the learning rate is 0.001 ，and batch-size = 52
The training image download link（link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1659QlXhnYBiugTHUj_L0nA?pwd=wjia 
Extraction code：wjia），and you can download the training image and put it in the project directory.
###testing
Directly run license plate detection Y file
###result

## Reference weight file
After downloading the weight file, put it under the ". / weight" folder（link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1659QlXhnYBiugTHUj_L0nA?pwd=wjia 
Extraction code：wjia）Note：The weight file has only trained 40000 times. If you want to achieve better results, you can increase the number of training times
